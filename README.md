# teaching_R
My core metrics discussion section materials from Spring 2020.

I tried to embed at least 4-5 exercises for each 50-minute class to keep students engaged. They would be "fill in the blank" style questions, and they would go on ahaslides during class to submit their answers. The RCheatSheet document already has the correct answers filled in, so you won't see any blanks.

Also, the ggplot2 lecture was kind of a trainwreck, so I rewrote it and it's sort of in a different style. It's very tempting to go overboard and get really technical because you get overexcited. It's really important to resist that urge because you'll just lose people.
